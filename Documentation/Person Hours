Estimate of Person Hours

Using the Agile user story method, we all came together and talked about the estimated cost of each task should take based on how long tasks from previous 
projects have taken us and averaged the time we all thought. Therefore, we estimate this prototype will likely take us roughly 3 hours and 30 minutes total. 
It will likely take an hour meeting to discuss our vision for the project, half an hour to write up how the project will function, half an hour to describe the 
software architecture of our prototype, half an hour for the use case diagram, half an hour for the design patterns question, and 30 minutes to set up the GitHub 
repository and to place our documentation there.

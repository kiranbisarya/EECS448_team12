# Connect 4

Our featured product will be a player vs player game of Connect 4. It will be done using Javascript and HTML. The game will start with player 1â€™s turn then switch turns until either a player wins or the board runs out of empty spaces. It will be accomplished through click event listeners on the board spaces on the HTML. The game will not allow a space that is already filled to be filled again. There will also be an event listener for the play again button. There will be a JavaScript file and a HTML file. Sound effects from Zapsplat.com.
